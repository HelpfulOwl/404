Fair Weather Hiker

Project with Calvin (@calvinleung0), Lacey (@laceycmccomas), Tom (@tlburchh) and Greg (@helpfulowl).


 This application allows the user to input a location and retrieve information about local hiking trails and relevant weather for that same region. 
  We are utilizing  the API of Google, hikingproject.com, and Darksky.net. When a user inputs the location of interest, then the same location’s weather is also retrieved. This way the user may see a map of local hiking trail with an exact position of each trail with further information such as conditions of the trail, how long it is, etc. The weather API gives information of weather alerts, 5 day / 3 day forecasts, and current weather.
  
*Future Plans*
  In addition to this functionality, to lighten it up, we would like to use the API untappd.com for locations of the nearest breweries.
The intention being that once you finish a good hike, you can have a blasting good pint o’ bitter.
Also there is the possibility of adding iNaturalist capability to the app.
